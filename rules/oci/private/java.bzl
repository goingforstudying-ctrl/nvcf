# Go and Rust services already use. Publicly pullable, multi-arch, and the same
# base the pre-Bazel service Dockerfiles use. Keep the JDK major version in
# lockstep with --java_language_version in //.bazelrc: a runtime older than the
# emitted bytecode fails at container startup with UnsupportedClassVersionError,
# which no build-time check catches.

# The distroless bases set ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/shelless_ulimit"], a shim that
# raises the soft file-descriptor limit before exec'ing the real command.
# oci_image REPLACES the base entrypoint rather than appending, so omitting the
# shim here would silently drop it and leave the container on the default 1024
# soft limit. Same fix grpc-proxy applies for its Go image.

# /usr/bin/java is present on both arches.
